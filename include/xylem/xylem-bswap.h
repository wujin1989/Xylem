/**
 * @brief Byte-swap a value of various integer or floating-point types.
 *
 * This type-generic macro automatically selects the appropriate byte-swap
 * function based on the type of the input argument. It supports signed and
 * unsigned integers (16-, 32-, and 64-bit) as well as IEEE 754 floating-point
 * types (float and double). The operation reverses the byte order of the
 * underlying representation, which is useful for converting between little-
 * and big-endian formats.
 *
 * @param x  Input value to be byte-swapped. Must be of one of the supported
 * types: uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, float, or
 * double.
 *
 * @return The byte-swapped value of the same type as the input.
 *
 * @note For floating-point types, the function reinterprets the bit pattern as
 * an unsigned integer, performs the byte swap, and safely reconstructs the
 *       floating-point value using memcpy to avoid undefined behavior.
